<!--summary: Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. Health is also about how good we feel.In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in "good health" or "healthy"). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."-->
